1. Put the error message inside a quotation mark to have the search engine find the **exact** match. For example, "Error message such as **can't find the property named 'map' of undefined**"

2. **site:URL**. For example, **site:codingphase.com html developer**

3. **Before:2010** and **after:2015**. We can filter the search output by using **before:year** and **after:year** keyword. For example, **angular after:2018** and **React before:2021**
