# Google-Search-Techniques-as-Software-Engineers

1. Put the error message inside a quotation mark to have the search engine find the **exact** match. For example,**"Error message such as can't find the property named 'map' of undefined**"

2. **site:URL**. For example, **site:codingphase.com html developer**

3. **Before:2010** and **after:2015**. We can filter the search output by using **before:year** and **after:year** keyword. For example, **angular after:2018** and **React before:2021**

4. **Range #..#** We can search from a  range of dates by simply putting **2 dots** between them. For example, **React courses 2018..2021**

5. **Logical OR | and Group ( )** We can use the **Pipe** operator as **OR**. For example, **(A | B)** as in Either A or B

6. ***Wildcard** To find all the subdomain within a specific website, Site:*.codingphase.com -www

7. **Filetype:pdf** To find a specific type of file, we can use **filetype** 

8. **Related:React.io** We can search about some specific tech/topic via the keyword **related:topic-name**
